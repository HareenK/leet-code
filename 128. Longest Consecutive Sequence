128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Hard

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Neat to use a hash map ..
        
        // [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
        
        unordered_set <int> set (nums.begin(), nums.end());
        // The fact that num-1 is not present in the set means we haven't see the current curr
        // in a 
        
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int num : set) {
            if (set.count(num-1) == 0) {
                int maxL = 1;
                int curr = num;
                while (set.count(curr+1) > 0) {
                    curr++; maxL += 1; 
                }
                result = max (maxL, result);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

// Neat --
